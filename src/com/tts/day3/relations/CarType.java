// An ENUM is a collection of pre-defined values
// that we can call inside of other parts of our program
// This is useful because it enforces that a developer puts in the correct
// input to methods, constructors, etc. and it also provides a single place
// that we can use for refactoring values

// These are constants

public enum CarType {
//	We can define a series of values associated with CarType:
	SEDAN,
	SUV,
	SPORT
}
